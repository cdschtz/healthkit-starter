# HealthKit Starter

Sample starter iOS App for querying and displaying HealthKit data such as Workouts or Steps taken per day. In order to receive SwiftLint feedback (is not necessary to deploy the App) upon building the project [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) needs to be installed locally.

This app serves the purpose of researching the structure and accuracy of HealthKit queried data in order to prepare for my [iPraktikum](https://ipraktikum.in.tum.de/upcoming/ipraktikum)'s project.

### Knowledge Base

All types of HK Types that can be queried can be found in [this file](knowledge-base/HealthKit-HKTypeIdentifiers.txt).
